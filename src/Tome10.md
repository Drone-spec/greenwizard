# Following a path

Welcome Wizards of tomorrow, We are fresh out of the block and back to snapping ankles on the mages court. Fuck all them constabulary mages, I hope your wands snap and backfire. But we are juju back on the beat ya hear. Time to play some "Desmon Doom"

We will be reaching into our robes and grabbing a project built by talented wizards. By attempting to see if we can add to or improve our understanding of a topic by attempting to learn how someone built a tool. In our process we seek to grow our understanding of a topic and the tool is just the construct by which we store our understanding.
