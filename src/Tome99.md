#The art of being anything at anytime with qemu


---

Qemu is a really great hypervisor that you can use to run virtual machines with a extream level of precision. The use case can be anything. Imagine you are on a plane and are running Linux but you wanna continue doing Malware Development on windows. Use Qemu to host a windows VM off on your computers and using the built in SMB share you can have a ready to roll testing environment.
