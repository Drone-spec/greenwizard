# Running a train with the homies

The building is a hackers dream. Tons of project boards that are set up to mimic a ICS water plant, Industrial Air system, possible weight transfer station, Cargo docks and loading systems.


While I am geeking out lets go to the Rail talk, Rail has stated it is saftey first, Saftey at the cost of security. Which makes sense ffor  the rail system. Issues facing the rail world are often not shared, So if a company finds an issue they will not share that discovery to other rail companies. The issue is that the industry becomes insular to each company. The issues can come in the way of just stopping trains. No one dies but millions of dollars could be lost due to productivity.

Military implication, Belarus hackers attack train systems to disrupt russian troops.

Computer in russia breached metro systems amid security conerns report says.

Hackers attack Russian railroads company that transports military goods.

Russia attacked poland and stopped the trains with a Political message being played, PSY-op attack.

" Unathorized Track switcherover, Collision, De-power the lines, take over marshalling systems"

Railway is a very very soft and easy to abuse environment 


## Types of trains

Highspeed Trains: Priority, Must be very quick and sensitive to speed.

Light weight Trains: Street train, Drivers will be dealing with people and speeds will be slow

Subway: Fast, yield to none, Very dependent on timing an orchestation / marshalling systems

Freight: Slow 



## Rail Glossary

- Point 
Point is a switch, on the rail. 

- Interlocking (IXL)

A system of managed points in mass. Think of like a 

- Balise / Axel counters

These are the Rail sensors that assist in the many services needed by trains for saftey.

- Signal

This is the method that allows train operators that to physically see the status of the rail ahead. This is a mechanical backup now due to the advancements made by the systems

- Automatic Train control ATC / PTC

Electronic system that allows control 

- Wayside Radio Unit (WRU)

Side Rail Way Radios that allows for the communication to the central offices, WiFi is often used as the communication system

- Catenary system

Energizer for the trains that allow trains to move via Electronic methods

- Automatic Fare Control (AFC)

This is the system that allows companies to make money, often internet facining

- Platform Screen Doors (PSD)

These are the doors that allow you to enter the train, Automated and often responsible for allowing fully automated train systems.

- Passenger Information Systems 
Departure board and Passengers need this to track and see times for the trains.


- OCC 

Head Quarters for the train systems. This is where the override systems are to be found and allows for overall management of the entire rail network. 

- Standard Gauge

The space between the railroads
Russian tracks are 1520mm
Standard is 1435mm

- CBTC

System that interlocks trains to a managed system. This allows trains to avoid running into eachother by using a fixed block system. The system will ensure that 2 trains cannot exist inside the same block at any time. It will send stop signals to the other trains to avoid a collision. 

- PTC
Radio Network 220MHz, Cellular

Back Office, Track Database, Speed Restriction, Work Zones, Train Constants, Movement Authorities,

- Wayside Signals, 
communicated to both train or waystations, 

Warning Curve, Breaking Curve.
