# Running a train with the homies.

This is my first venture into the ugly world of ICS on mobile metal boxes. While my fellow wizard homies made it quite apparant that our hexes and incantations have inflicted havoc before on ICS of a more static variety. This was to be my very first venture into this dark and dank world. ICS is often spoken of in hushed tones full of woe and dispare among cyber wizards. Many of our kind tell harrowing tales of encountering machines beyond time and space. Networks of old held together by the most archaic networking magics. I am filled with hope and youthful energies at the chance to see such great works. This shall be my recording of these events.
