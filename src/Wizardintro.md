# Pondering the first orb

Hello, fellow of the cyber arts. This is a rough collections of a wizards journey. I will post serious and joking things on here. This is more for me than it is for you. However if you find this useful then side quest complete.

## About me:

"A spiritual gangster serving a life sentence in a human body." - Burialgoods

Im the type of rogue wizard that gets the nervous shakes when I go a day without typing on a keyboard. Loving the journey of Malware development and CTF adventures with the gang. Slamming some drink and going crazy on HTB seasons is peak living.
