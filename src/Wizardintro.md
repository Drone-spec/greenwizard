Well updates abound but where to start
- Feb 09 2024 A wizards life can sure take some turns. The mages judiciary has been making this wizards life hell. I am forbidden from casting my type of spells until they finish there magical investigation... Which is taking forever, But to quite another wise mage "This too shall pass" However, it has been a great time to just mess around casting some apprentice incantations and improve my ability in other forms of casting. Soon I shall master Win32API, and I hope to get my OSCE^3. Another badge to add to my Casting Certifications.
