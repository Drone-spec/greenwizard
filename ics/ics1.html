<p>Wizard Groups in attendance: The Cyber Threat Emulators wizard court, And my current home which I shall dub the Contractor wizard court.</p>
<p>This is my first venture into the ugly world of ICS on mobile metal boxes. While my fellow wizard homies made it quite apparent that our hexes and incantations have inflicted havoc before on ICS of a more static variety. This was to be my very first venture into this dark and dank world. ICS is often spoken of in hushed tones full of woe and dispare among cyber wizards. Many of our kind tell harrowing tales of encountering machines beyond time and space. Networks of old held together by the most archaic networking magics. I am filled with hope and youthful energies at the chance to see such great works. This shall be my recording of these events.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-for-an-odyssey"><a class="header" href="#preparing-for-an-odyssey">Preparing for an odyssey.</a></h2>
<p>We must prepare as we have been given our topics.</p>
<ol>
<li>Python(requests, scapy, pyrtlsdr, pyshark, BACpypes)</li>
<li>Network Recon(nmap, masscan)</li>
<li>Wireless Surveys(Kismet, Airodump-ng)</li>
<li>Payload Building(msfvenom, empire, veil)</li>
<li>PCAP Analysis (Wireshark, Tcpdump)</li>
<li>Vulnerability Scanning(OpenVAS, Nessus, nmap NSE Scripts, openscap, lynis)</li>
<li>SQL Injection(sqlmap, OWASP ZAP)</li>
</ol>
<p>As a small court of wizards the time to start researching and obsessing over trains like true enlightened individuals had begun. We searched all over the internet for videos related to train control systems. Abusing the usual suspects we got a ton of important information in relation to most of the ICS environments. FCC submittions and documentation proved to be very eye opening into the way that these systes act and work. We learned critical frequency channels, methods of communication, and how the system should work. We know from many many lectures and talks on the matter that safety is number one. Which means the systems should default to a safe standby. While I always want a secure first approach in the matter of public transit the idea of safety should come first. This does however leave us with issues we must talk about. </p>
<h2 id="saftey-first"><a class="header" href="#saftey-first">Saftey first</a></h2>
<p>The concept of saftey above all means security will take a backseat. This backseat is going to be in the form of in an unsure situation a train must come to a stop. This is to ensure human life is the most protected asset. Avoid harm at all costs. This puts into my mind the concept of any method that might be used to alert the trains to situations where human harm might be possible should be robust and simple. Less parts of the system would translate into easy of use and less prone to faults. However, welcome to the real world where issues are constant with these systems. This is not slander on the makers of systems but the constant pressure you see from mis-management of projects.</p>
<h2 id="public-transparency"><a class="header" href="#public-transparency">Public transparency</a></h2>
<p>The public always has a right to know and understand the methods and processes behind the means to transportation we trust our lives with. The concept of hiding information is a valid one for many systems and methods. Not letting the public know how certain critical infrastructure works to prevent abuse by outside actors has a lot of validity. However as a saftey first mentality we must release the methods and systems. The release of this critical information is a danger due to the ability of someone with malicious intent or simulated intent can as we showcase make use of this public information to cause failures in a system resulting in some very bad times for a sensitive system.</p>
<p><code>Notes from far after the event</code> I still hold the idea that releasing the methods behind systems can be a major issue. But I think the goal of public review of systems can net a lot of benfit barring that the systems in place are able to be issued updates. If updates are impossible then well dang we are kinda stuck and the less people can test the system the better we are with skeletons in the closet.</p>
<h2 id="private-and-public-sector-forced-co-operation"><a class="header" href="#private-and-public-sector-forced-co-operation">Private and public sector forced co-operation</a></h2>
<p>While I do not accept any private company telling me they are working with my best interest in mind. I do however understand that given enough fee's and jail time a company might act in my interest only due to state applied pressure. The private sector will abuse a system as much as they can. Sorry if this sounds like a rant but it does apply. In our research you will begin to find a lot of workers in the rail industry talking about automation and the lay-offs happening even now. At the Hack The Railroad 2023 event the leaders of these companies even talk joyfully about a full automation solution. However as a security-mancer and or wizard I see this as a perfect system for abuse. No human interaction for complex systems is a very fast and dangerous route to embark on. Once an exploit is found and used the time it would take to correct a fault like that would be fatal to an automated system that rely on perfect timing. Imagine stopping a train in the middle of some far off woods far from human enabled midigation. I pale at the thought of someone first finding the issue, sending a team to investigate, beginning the process of trying to clear the fault or whatever, getting the system back into a working state. Global shipping is a great model for this behavoir. Once the Evergreen ship was stuck </p>
<p>Oh uh, yeah anyhow long story short, a lack of humans is a very bad time when you have a system that could be attacked and left unattended. Even tho most industrial processes can and have been automated we still have humans very near to prevent some kind of critical failure.</p>
<h1 id="when-wizards-meet"><a class="header" href="#when-wizards-meet">When wizards meet</a></h1>
<p>As we made our way to the event. I connected with some friends who also planned on attending. Hard cut to us breaking out a HackRF and other SDR solutions we went to all learning how Radio Frequency works and the technology behind a lot of that type of magic. We had two plans, Running a couple of trains with the wizards court and finding out how drunk the apprentence mages could get. (They had added four new mages to the team in my absence) </p>
<p>So as the moon greeted our arcane shinanigans and formal tutoring of the apprentence mages on alcohol based potion crafting our chaos was palpable. Our night was a blur of RF door hacking and hotel staff frustrations and the dawn was soon approaching.</p>
<h1 id="beasts-of-iron-and-fire"><a class="header" href="#beasts-of-iron-and-fire">Beasts of iron and fire</a></h1>
<p>Making our way to DreamPort we did the usual sign in and grabbing badges. Making our way past all the non-technical speeches I quickly went to the practical area. Now side note this is a great example of social engineering. Tables had name plates on them. Now we had been told that the event had run out of room for any more groups showing up. So I decided I had driven too far and prepare too much to be told no. So I dropped my stuff and acted like I was a helper. Noticed that all the people helping had merch jackets. So off to the shop I went. Got a cheap jacket and now I fit right in. Locating my old wizard groups table I notice two tables right next to them so I just moved the name plate to a empty table and began moving my stuff and with little to no fuss I had now scored a table. A few of the other groups had begun setting up so I found the first event of the day a induction speech and had my group ditch so we could go set up. We then just held down the table and no one so much as batted an eye to a group of CTF people setting up early and doing some updates and checking of scripts before the CTF began. Often people in cyber secuirty are way too introverted to want to cause an issue and if you dont act like an ass or cause a disturbance you can often be ignored. <code>AUTHORS NOTE: I too am in the introverted group. However I do recognize that if I would find it to be a hassle I know someone else would feel the same. I exploit my own feelings and hope for like minding people around me.</code></p>
<h2 id="the-stage-is-set"><a class="header" href="#the-stage-is-set">The stage is set</a></h2>
<p>With our Table, our Team, and our confidence full we took an early look at some of the physical challenges. A couple of train networks set up with switches and some ESP32 sensors strewn around. Many of the tracks had very cool home brew solutions to trip and trigger. After asking when the event was over it a lot of MQTT and some python holding the entire thing together. Kind of expected as much but it was a really nice set up with logic gates and what not. </p>
